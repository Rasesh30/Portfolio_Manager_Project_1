## Project Overview:

While working for a large equity-trading company, our team is tasked with researching our clientâ€™s portfolio. Our client has an interest in investing within the magnificent 7 tech companies, specifically Apple, Nvidia, Amazon  and Tesla and need expert analysis to invest and make the best calculated decisions with data backing it up. In our example, we will be pulling data from NASDAQ (https://data.nasdaq.com/) and examining the last year of trading data. We will examine which stocks trended upwards, downwards, and which we recommend most by performing an extensive comparative analysis.

## Research Questions:

1) How do the returns of Nvidia, Tesla, Apple, and Amazon compare over  the past year?
2) What trends and volitity patterns do they follow?
3) What investment reccomendations can be made on the comparative performance analysis?

## Statistical Analysis Techniques:

In order to manipulate, compare and contrast our data, we follow different statistical analysis techniques to discover patterns and findings. Then, we back up our observations with beautiful visuals to help communicate the message.

As our data was prepared, we focsued on several statistical analysis techniques and perspectives to help us solve our research questions.
1) Aggregation - Our first focus, calculating the average daily returns over the past year of each stock.
2) Correlation - Determining correlations between each stock and if they follow common trends.
3) Comparision - Comparing cumulutive returns over the past year.
4) Summary Statistics - Calculating summary statistics such as mean, standard deciation, percientiles for daily returns.

## Key Visualizations and Patterns
In order to understand and compare the selected stocks, we must focus on several reserach topics:
1) Calculating mean daily returns from the past year, for reach stock, helps give the average performance and return, in which we can compare and further evaluate which stocks would be better in placing investment positions in, with different graph representations such as bar and line graphs.
2) Calculating standard deviation of cumulutive returns, as well as heatmap summaries of cumuluative returns and  percentiles and mean returns.
3) Trendlines of closing prices for selected stocks, from the past year.
4) Comparing mean vs standard deviation of cumulutive returns with plot graph visual.
5) Bollinger Bands showing market volatility and identifying overbought/oversold conditions.
